      <p>I was born in Seattle in 1994, and I've lived here in the Pacific Northwest for my entire life. I lived in Bellingham for 6 years while I was going to school at Western Washington University, and now I'm back in Ballard. One of my favorite hobbies is playing video games, and though I play both on console and PC, overall I have to say that PC is my favorite. My dog's name is Bailey, she's a 4 year old yellow lab mix, and she is such a sweetheart. I have a sometimes deadpan, sometimes extremely dumb sense of humor, and Zoolander appeals perfectly to me. (I'm also a big fan of Owen Wilson.) And I'm really not picky when it comes to food - I'll eat just about anything.</p>
